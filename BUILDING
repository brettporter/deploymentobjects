To build:
mvn clean antlr3:antlr compile test

On mac, when installing libvirt via macports, java can't seem to find the shared library:
java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError: Unable to load library 'virt': dlopen(libvirt.dylib, 9): image not found
To Fix, add to the environment:
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/local/lib
Also for libvirt connections, mac socket file locations are different, so append 
?socket=path.  Ex: qemu+ssh://ino/system?socket=/var/run/libvirt/libvirt-sock"

Building Documentation:
(Ubuntu) apt-get install texlive-full
(CentOS/RedHat/Fedora) yum install texlive*
(MacOS - Using MacPorts) port install texlive texlive-science texlive-latex-extra texlive-generic-recommended
mvn latex:latex
Some integration tests depend on libvirt and zookeeper to be installed and running.
