% Example SDSU Mathematics LaTeX Thesis.
% Lines beginning with % are comments and are ignored.
% 
% The class file sdsu-thesis.cls must be in the current directory or
% installed with the other classes as per standard LaTeX installation.
% 
% To generate run these commands:
% latex  thesis
% bibtex thesis
% latex  thesis
% latex  thesis
% Then you need to use the dvips command to get postscript output
% 
% See the README file for more information
% 
\documentclass{sdsu-thesis}
% 
% For early printouts to save paper use the savepaper option as
% 
% \documentclass[savepaper]{sdsu-thesis}
% 
% 
% This will make things single spaced, use small font and smaller
% margins.  Stuff will be formatted differently if you don't use this
% option but it's useful to basically see (read) what you typed so far
% on paper without wasting much paper.  You might want to also comment
% out the front matter and backmatter if printing out in savepaper
% mode to save paper there.  Do not use this option on your final
% printout as it doesn't satisfy the thesis manual requirements.

% Also if you want to use double spacing rather then singlespacing (if
% your thesis is very short, say 25 pages or less), then use the
% `doublespace' option as
% 
% \documentclass[doublespace]{sdsu-thesis}

% For including graphics use
% (Info) http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Importing_Graphics
%
% NOTE: My *may* need the graphicx package to get the correct
% page-size (letter) for your document... Some environments,
% e.g. TeXnicCenter default to 'a4' page size.
\usepackage{epsfig}
\usepackage{graphicx}

% These packages may also be useful for pictures...
% \usepackage{color}
% \usepackage{eepic}
% \usepackage{epic}
% \usepackage{grapic}


% Since this is a math thesis, you quite likely want these:
\usepackage{amsmath}
\usepackage{amsfonts}
\usepackage{amssymb}
\usepackage{amsthm}

% This makes captions *bold*
\usepackage[bf,labelsep=period,textfont=bf]{caption}

% Other useful packages for theses (see LaTeX docs for descriptions of these)
% 
% For the \vref commands that also prints out the reference page
% \usepackage{varioref}
% 
% For including computer code
% \usepackage{alltt}
% 
% For the \url{http://foo.com} command to include url's (or filenames)
% \usepackage{url}
% 
% For multi page tables
\usepackage{longtable}


% This package countains the \sout command (which you should never use!)
\usepackage[normalem]{ulem}

\newtheoremstyle{dtm}% name of the style to be used
  {0pt}% measure of space to leave above the theorem. E.g.: 3pt
  {0pt}% measure of space to leave below the theorem. E.g.: 3pt
  {\slshape}% name of font to use in the body of the theorem
  {0pt}% measure of space to indent
  {\bfseries}% name of head font
  {. }% punctuation between head and body
  {0pt}% space after theorem head
  {}% Manually specify head
\theoremstyle{dtm}

% The style of theorems and such that you want to use.  You can change
% the style by modifying the second argument (for example prepending a
% formatting command, e.g. \textsc{Theorem} which will make the
% headings come out as small caps rather then bold).
% 
% On second thought, don't change these formats as you are likely to
% incur the wrath of the Thesis Reviewer.

% Author name and the author name in upper case
% (FORMAT) Has to match university records, check if you have
% (FORMAT) full middle name, or middle initital on record.
\author{F. David Thomas}

% Title of the thesis (all in upper case), use \\ for line breaks as
% usual, you can use up to 4 lines and make sure to set the counter
% titlelines to the number of lines you used.
% 
% This is for the title page
% 
\title{DEPLOYMENT OBJECTS, A TOOL THAT SUPPLEMENTS INDUSTRY STANDARD
TOOLS WITH GRAMMARS, EVENTS, ORCHESTRATION, AND A RICH DOMAIN MODEL
TO SOLVE DISTRIBUTED DEPLOYMENT AND MAINTENANCE PROBLEMS }
% Number of lines in the title, without setting this the title page
% will not be formatted properly
\setcounter{titlelines}{4}

% Heading style title, the number of lines can be different here then
% in titlelines and in fact the thesis manual requires that this be at
% most 3 lines long so only put at most 2 pagebreaks here.  This is
% for the abstract pages and the signature page.
% 
% (FORMAT) Make sure that this title has the EXACT same words at the
% (FORMAT) title-page-title
% 
\titleheading{Deployment Objects, a tool that supplements industry
standard tools with grammars, events, orchestration, and a rich domain
model to solve distributed deployment and maintenance problems}

%
% (FORMAT) The "degree" is set on three lines; select one of the
% following formats.  See DTM P.41
%
% Degree (MA-Math)
%\degreeONE{Master of Arts}
%\degreeTWO{in}
%\degreeTHREE{Mathematics}

% Degree (MS-Math)
%\degreeONE{Master of Science}
%\degreeTWO{in}
%\degreeTHREE{Mathematics}

% Degree (with Concentration)
\degreeONE{Master of Science in Applied Mathematics}
\degreeTWO{with a Concentration in}
\degreeTHREE{Dynamical Systems}

% Degree (dual, concurrent)
%\degreeONE{Master of Science in Computer Science}
%\degreeTWO{}
%\degreeTHREE{}


% If you need to change the word 'Thesis' use \thesisname{Blah} and if
% you need to change the middle line between \degree and \degreein on
% the titlepage to something other then 'in' use \inofand{of} to use
% 'of' for instance.  (This should not be necessary)
